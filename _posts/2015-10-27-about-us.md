Located in southern California + available worldwide, we would love to meet you!
But first, a little about us:

We both are crazy about all things technology and found ourselves spending many of our wedding couple consults enjoying good conversation about the world's best lenses, 3D printers, Apple watches, and extreme engineering. We totally geek out about the amazing transformation in our world as we experience new technology big and small--did you know people can print an ear now? A human ear. Things are getting real.
Okay, so although we are not printing body appendages over here, we do enjoy our 3D printer on our off-time coming up with inventive prototypes and handy gadgets. If you have a 3D printer, check out thingiverse, your mind will be blown with what you have accessible to print without having to design a thing.
We also recently got a new bike. And yes, if you know us well you know we like ourselves a classic motorcycle so it's a 1985 Harley Davidson Sportster XLH with power for days and a sweet roar of victory. Of course our riding experience wouldn't have been the same without classy Bell Bullit helmets to match, which you can see in the shot of Ryan riding above. We ride together just about everyday and enjoy the time together without the need for words or music, just the passing landscapes and warm fuzzies we get from just the love of doing life together.
We also enjoy the simple things. Jasmin enjoys unsweetened green tea at her leisure and Ryan crafts himself a mean cup of espresso every day of the week.
Let's get to know each other better, yeah?
